# Monkeypox Data

### Analyzing the data produced by the Global.health team on the 2022 monkeypox outbreak

This data is compiled exclusively from publicly-available sources, and is collated by the team at [global.health](https://www.global.health/).
Their data is updated as new information is being reported. We fetch the latest version of the data every hour, and include data up to the previous day.
Sources for each case are listed [here](https://github.com/globaldothealth/monkeypox/blob/main/latest.csv).

Please check permissions before publishing this data and refer back to each source and the global.health team if you decide to so: _Global.health Monkeypox (accessed on YYYY-MM-DD)._

Global.health maintains a data dictionary and machine readable files [in their own GitHub repository](https://github.com/globaldothealth/monkeypox). Should you identify any inconsistencies in the data or have additional information or questions, please get in touch with them [here](https://github.com/globaldothealth/monkeypox/issues).
